## Common Business Use Cases

### 1. Revenue Recognition
```javascript
const revenue = {
  amount: invoice.amount_paid / 100, // Convert cents to dollars
  currency: invoice.currency,
  customer_id: invoice.customer,
  transaction_date: new Date(invoice.status_transitions.paid_at * 1000),
  billing_period: {
    start: new Date(invoice.period_start * 1000),
    end: new Date(invoice.period_end * 1000)
  }
};
```

### 2. Customer Service Access
```javascript
const serviceUpdate = {
  customer_id: invoice.customer,
  subscription_id: invoice.subscription,
  service_active: invoice.paid,
  next_billing_date: new Date(invoice.lines.data[0].period.end * 1000),
  plan_name: invoice.lines.data[0].price.nickname
};
```

### 3. Communication Triggers
```javascript
const emailData = {
  to: invoice.customer_email,
  customer_name: invoice.customer_name,
  amount_paid: `$${(invoice.amount_paid / 100).toFixed(2)}`,
  invoice_url: invoice.hosted_invoice_url,
  receipt_url: invoice.invoice_pdf,
  service_period: `${new Date(invoice.period_start * 1000).toLocaleDateString()} - ${new Date(invoice.period_end * 1000).toLocaleDateString()}`
};
```

### 4. Analytics and Reporting
```javascript
const analyticsData = {
  revenue: invoice.amount_paid / 100,
  mrr_contribution: invoice.billing_reason === 'subscription_cycle' ? invoice.amount_paid / 100 : 0,
  customer_ltv_update: invoice.customer,
  churn_risk_update: false, // Payment succeeded
  product_performance: invoice.lines.data.map(item => ({
    product_id: item.price.product,
    revenue: item.amount / 100,
    quantity: item.quantity
  }))
};
```

## Important Fields for Different Business Functions

### üí≥ Billing Team
- `amount_paid`, `currency`, `total`
- `invoice_pdf`, `hosted_invoice_url`
- `payment_intent`, `charge`
- `billing_reason`

### üõí Product Team
- `lines.data[].price.product`
- `lines.data[].quantity`
- `lines.data[].description`
- `subscription_details.metadata`

### üìä Analytics Team
- `amount_paid`, `currency`
- `customer`, `subscription`
- `billing_reason`
- `period_start`, `period_end`

### üéØ Marketing Team
- `customer_email`, `customer_name`
- `amount_paid` (for LTV calculations)
- `billing_reason` (new vs. renewal)
- `subscription` (for segmentation)

### üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Team
- `id` (invoice ID for references)
- `subscription` (for account management)
- `metadata` (custom business logic)
- `webhooks_delivered_at` (for debugging)

## Metadata Usage

The `txnId` in the subscription metadata (`subscription_details.metadata.txnId`) appears to be your internal transaction ID. This is valuable for:

- Correlating Stripe events with internal systems
- Tracking payments across multiple platforms
- Debugging payment flows
- Customer support inquiries

## Date Handling

All Stripe timestamps are Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch). Convert them to JavaScript Date objects:

```javascript
const paidDate = new Date(invoice.status_transitions.paid_at * 1000);
const servicePeriodStart = new Date(invoice.period_start * 1000);
const servicePeriodEnd = new Date(invoice.period_end * 1000);
```

## Error Handling Considerations

Even in successful payments, monitor these fields for edge cases:

- `amount_remaining` should be 0 for full payments
- `attempt_count` indicates if payment required multiple attempts
- `collection_method` shows if payment was automatic or manual
- `billing_reason` helps distinguish between different types of charges

## Security Considerations

- Never log full payment details in plain text
- Mask sensitive customer information in logs
- Use Stripe's `customer` ID instead of storing payment details
- Verify webhook signatures before processing

## Integration Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**: Update customer account status, send confirmation emails
2. **Async Processing**: Update analytics, generate reports, sync with other systems
3. **Monitoring**: Track payment processing times, failure rates, revenue metrics
4. **Customer Experience**: Provide immediate service access, send receipts
